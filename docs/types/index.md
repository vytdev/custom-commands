# Type Parsers

These built-in argument type parsers are essential for handling various types
of command arguments in your addon. You can use them to ensure that the received
input is correctly processed according to the specified types.

- [`boolean`](./boolean.md)

These argument type parsers are valuable tools for accurately processing numeric
inputs. They validate and parse input values while adhering to the specific
requirements of each data type, allowing you to handle a wide range of numeric
scenarios with ease.
